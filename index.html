            <h1>Dog Breed</h1>
            <small>Mr.Ritam</small>
            <p>Probably one of the most recognisable and best loved dogs, 
                the Golden Retriever is known for their lustrous, medium-length 
                golden coat and ever-wagging tail. This large retriever has a friendly 
                expression with perfect symmetry and superb,
                flowing movement covering the ground with long, powerful strides.</p>
                <h3>Golden Retriever</h3>
                <img src="assets/img/golden retriver.jpg" alt="dog">
                <p>The Golden Retriever is a gentle dog with a level disposition, 
                    and usually adapts well to family life. They love to be involved 
                    in all matters, whether indoors or outdoors. They are foremost a 
                    retriever and will attempt to drag, pull or carry anything they can 
                    fit into their mouths. They also love water and care should be taken 
                    to ensure their safety when any form of water is nearby. Golden Retrievers 
                    are, however, worriers, and great care should be taken during training, 
                    ensuring sensitivity is maintained at all times.
                    As long as they have been introduced to cats and other furries as a puppy, 
                    they will happily live with all other household animals.
                    The Golden Retriever will suit an owner or family who are active and love 
                    the great outdoors, and who want a friendly trainable large dog who needs 
                    lots of exercise and will join in with all activities with joy - and love everyone.</p>
